🌟 Introduction
Accurately estimating property prices is a critical task in the real estate industry. This machine learning model uses historical property data to predict prices. It helps buyers, sellers, and real estate agents make data-driven decisions.

🔍 Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical data.
Machine Learning: Implements Random Forest Regressor for predictions.
Metrics: Evaluates model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared Score (R²).
🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
⚙️ Setup
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and the following libraries installed:


pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/anjani-ai/property-price-prediction.git
cd property-price-prediction
Place your dataset (house_data.csv) in the project folder.

Run the script:


python main.py


🚀 Usage
Train the Model: The script will preprocess the dataset and train a Random Forest Regressor.

Evaluate Performance: The trained model is evaluated on test data using MSE and R².

Make Predictions: Input new property features to predict the price.

📊 Dataset
This project uses the Ames Housing Dataset. You can replace it with your own dataset, ensuring it contains similar property features.

Dataset Example:
Feature	Description	Example Value
LotArea	Lot size in square feet	8450
YearBuilt	Year the house was built	2003
GrLivArea	Above-ground living area	1710
BedroomAbvGr	Number of bedrooms	3
SalePrice	Sale price of the property	208500
📈 Model Performance
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 12345.67
R² Score: 0.85
The model demonstrates a strong ability to predict property prices based on the provided features.
